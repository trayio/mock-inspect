# How to use and setup

See below for the available methods. For many examples, check out our [extensive suite of tests](https://github.com/trayio/mock-request/tree/master/src/tests). The types for the possible option objects have been extensively annotated - make use of your IDE hints to see the full details for each property.

## Setup

Our mocking solution has to be set up and torn down accordingly after tests. The method `cleanUpNetworkRequestMocking` should run before **each** of your tests, `setUpNetworkRequestMocking()` **once** before all of your tests, and `tearDownNetworkRequestMocking` **once** after all of your tests. How setup steps have to be invoked depends on your test runner. With jest, we would create a [setupTestFrameworkFile](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/23.x/configuration#setuptestframeworkscriptfile-string) which would register the following hooks:

```js
const {
    cleanUpNetworkRequestMocking,
    setUpNetworkRequestMocking,
    tearDownNetworkRequestMocking
} = require("mock-request")

beforeEach(() => {
    cleanUpNetworkRequestMocking()
})

beforeAll(() => {
    setUpNetworkRequestMocking()
})

afterAll(() => {
    tearDownNetworkRequestMocking()
})
```

### Persistent auto-generated graphQL responses in the setup phase

For graphQL APIs, we expose functionality in the setup phase to automtically generate graphQL responses from a schema throughout your entire test suite. (These can be overridden if necessary though). The below example sets up the test suite in such a way so that any graphQL request going against thisdomaindoesnotexist.com/graphql will be evaluated against the provided graphQLSchema and an automatic response will be generated. [Refer to the type definitions](https://github.com/trayio/mock-request/tree/master/src/types/GraphQLAutoMockStartupOptions.ts) for all available options.

```js
beforeAll(() => {
    setUpNetworkRequestMocking({
        persistentAutoGeneratedGraphQLMocks: [
            {
                requestPattern: "https://thisdomaindoesnotexist.com/graphql",
                graphQLSchema: schemaString,
            },
        ]
    })
})
```

### Enable unmocked network requests to pass the network

By default, network requests that aren't expected to be mocked will throw an error saying that a response handler hasn't been set up for this request. You can disable this behaviour by passing the option `blockUnmockedNetworkRequests: true` into the `setUpNetworkRequestMocking` method.

```js
    setUpNetworkRequestMocking({
        allowUnmockedRequestsOnNetwork: true
    })
```

# Available functions and classes

## mockRequest

Mocks a request from scratch using the details you provide and returns a [MockedRequest](#mockedrequest). When creating multiple mocks for the same URL, the last mock will always be used.

Receives an object which defines the properties of the request to be mocked and the response to be returned. [Check out the type definition](https://github.com/trayio/mock-request/tree/master/src/types/MockResponseOptions.ts) for details of properties you can enter.

```js
const {mockRequest} = require("mock-request")

const loginRequest = mockRequest({
    requestPattern: "https://www.yourwebsite.com/login",
    requestMethod: "POST",
    responseStatus: 201,
    responseBody: "Welcome!",
    responseHeaders: {
        "Authorization": "take your token good sir!"
    }
})
// Make a network request somewhere in your actual code
loginRequest.expectNetworkRequestToHaveBeenMade()
```

### Using graphQL with mockRequest

Pass the property `graphQLMutationName` or `graphQLQueryName` which should align with the query or mutation you are mocking. In order for this to work, the graphQL requests by your application **have** to be made with a JSON payload (`content-type: application/json` header) that includes the `query` property.

```js
const firstMockedRequest = mockRequest({
    graphQLMutationName: "FirstMutation",
    responseBody: "Was set up first",
    requestMethod: "POST",
})
const secondMockedRequest = mockRequest({
    graphQLQueryName: "SecondQuery",
    responseBody: "Was set up second",
    requestMethod: "POST",
})

// Receives the mocked response "Was set up second" although was called first
await request(`query SecondQuery { animals { cats } }`)
// Receives the mocked response "Was set up first" although was called second
await request(`mutation FirstMutation(call: "Meow") { id }`)
```

## mockRequestFromContract

Mocks a request based on a contract you pass into and returns a [MockedRequest](#mockedrequest). A contract is an object which holds all the details of a network request - how it is supposed to be made and what it is supposed to return. [Check out the type definition](https://github.com/trayio/mock-request/tree/master/src/Contract.ts) for details of properties you can enter.

```js
const {mockRequestFromContract} = require("mock-request")

const loginContract = {
    response: {
        statusCode: 201,
        body: "Welcome!",
        headers: {
            "Authorization": "take your token good sir!"
        }
    },
    request: {
        url: "https://www.yourwebsite.com/login",
        method: "POST",
        payload: {
            "username": "HanSolo",
            "password": "Never tell me the odds!"
        }
    }
}
const loginRequest = mockRequestFromContract(loginContract)
// Make a network request somewhere in your actual code
loginRequest.expectRequestMadeMatchingContract()
```

## MockedRequest

Every time you mock a request, you get hold of this class which has the following methods:

### expectRequestMadeMatching

Asserts that the network request you mocked was called with the expected properties. [Check out the type definition](https://github.com/trayio/mock-request/tree/master/src/ExpectRequestMadeMatchingInput.ts) for details of the properties you can provide here.

If you created your mocked request from a contract, you most likely want to use [expectRequestMadeMatchingContract](##expectrequestmadematchingcontract) instead.

```js
const loginRequest = mockRequest({/* mock details go here */})
loginRequest.expectRequestMadeMatching({
    requestPayload: {
        "username": "HanSolo",
        "password": "Never tell me the odds!"
    },
    requestHeaders: {
        "Authorization": "I provided my token in the request header"
    }
})
```

### expectRequestMadeMatchingContract

Asserts that the network request you mocked was called with the expected properties as provided in the contract. [Check out the type definition](https://github.com/trayio/mock-request/tree/master/src/Contract.ts) for details of how a Contract looks like.

If you create your MockedRequest using `mockRequestFromContract`, you *do not* have to pass in any arguments. If you created your MockedRequest using `mockRequest`, you have to pass in a contract.

```js
const loginContract = {
    response: {
        statusCode: 201,
        body: "Welcome!",
        headers: {
            "Authorization": "take your token good sir!"
        }
    },
    request: {
        url: "https://www.yourwebsite.com/login",
        method: "POST",
        payload: {
            "username": "HanSolo",
            "password": "Never tell me the odds!"
        }
    }
}

// When created using mockRequestFromContract:
const loginRequest = mockRequestFromContract(loginContract)
loginRequest.expectRequestMadeMatchingContract()

// When created using mockRequest:
const loginRequest = mockRequest({/* mock details go here */})
loginRequest.expectRequestMadeMatchingContract(loginContract)
```

### expectNetworkRequestToHaveBeenMade

Asserts that the network request you mocked also has been called.

```js
const loginRequest = mockRequest({/* mock details go here */})
loginRequest.expectNetworkRequestToHaveBeenMade()
```

### expectNetworkRequestToNotHaveBeenMade

Asserts that the network request you mocked was not called.

```js
const loginRequest = mockRequest({/* mock details go here */})
loginRequest.expectNetworkRequestToNotHaveBeenMade()
```

## logMockedRequests

A convenience helper to look behind the scenes of mock-proxy: prints out all the mocks that have been registered during the test.

```js
const {logMockedRequests} = require("mock-proxy")
logMockedRequests()
```

# Using GraphQL

We also support GraphQL - both in terms of mocking and making assertions!

## Mocking graphQL calls by query or mutation name
As outlined [in the section about mockRequest](###using-graphql-with-mockrequest), you have to provide an additional property to pass in the query or mutation name you are mocking so that we know you are mocking a graphQL request.

## Auto-generating graphQL responses
If desired, we can automatically generate a random graphQL response for you. That way, you don't have to manually define the `responseBody` property. In order to do so, you need to provide us with the graphQL schema of the request that will be made, in the property `graphQLAutoMocking.schema`. (When `graphQLAutoMocking.schema` **and** `responseBody` is given, we will always use the `responseBody` property.)

Consider the following example:

```js
// Note that `responseBody` is not given
const mockedGQLRequestWithSchema = mockRequest({
    requestPattern: /\/graphql/i,
    requestMethod: "POST",
    graphQLQueryName: "MyCoolQuery",
    graphQLAutoMocking: {
        // `schema` accepts a graphQL schema as string. An example:
        // https://github.com/trayio/mock-request/blob/master/src/tests/fixtures/simpleGraphQLSchemaString.ts
        schema: simpleGraphQLExampleSchemaString,
    },
})
// The response to this request will be automtically generated. It will look like:
// { me: { name: "Drucill Hubert Lewse the Comer of Avera rejoices Fiann Craggy Florie and 5 hard trouts" } }
const response = await exampleGraphQLPostRequestJson(`
    query MyCoolQuery {
        me {
            name
        }
    }
`)
```

### Setting a fixed length or range for auto-generated array responses
The property `graphQLAutoMocking.fixedArrayLengths` can be used to set a fixed array length or range for arrays that will be auto-generated. For this to work, we need to know of the type and the property in format `type.property` and the desired length/range.

Consider the below example: We are mocking a graphQL request that is expected to return a `users` array. [As we can see on the schema](https://github.com/trayio/mock-request/blob/master/src/tests/fixtures/simpleGraphQLSchemaString.ts#L28), the `users` property sits underneath type `Query`. If we want that the `users` array will be of length `3`, we would  pass `"Query.users": 3`. If we want it to be between the lengths 3 and 7, we would pass `"Query.users": [3, 7]`.

```js
const mockedGQLRequestWithSchema = mockRequest({
    requestPattern: /\/graphql/i,
    requestMethod: "POST",
    graphQLQueryName: "MyCoolQuery",
    graphQLAutoMocking: {
        schema: simpleGraphQLExampleSchemaString,
        fixedArrayLengths: {
            "Query.users": [3, 7],
        },
    },
})
// The property `users` in this response will be of length between 3 and 7
await exampleGraphQLPostRequestJson(`
    query MyCoolQuery {
        users {
            id,
            email,
        }
    }
`)
```

## Making graphQL contract assertions
A note on comparing actual graphQL requests against your defined expectations: Whenever we realise that you created a mock using a URL that ended in `/graphql`, we will assume that you are using a GraphQL API. In order to compare the request payloads, we convert both payloads to JSON objects - basically a **reverse** version of the library [json-to-graphql-query](https://github.com/dupski/json-to-graphql-query). We can then compare these two objects against each other to check whether all properties have been set or whether some have been missing.

# Unresolved promises in tests, i.e. React tests with jest
Currently, [jest provides no API to flush promises](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/2157) on its own. But flushing promises is necessary to have jest execute all built-up promises - and network responses are also promises. Therefore, it is necessary that you flush the built-up promises accordingly manually. For this use case, we recommend using [the async utility `waitFor` which is provided by the "Testing Library" project](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/api-async#waitfor). Alternatively, you could create your own function which flushes a promise and call it as many times as needed:

```js
export const flushPromises = async () => {
    await new Promise(setImmediate)
}
// Call `flushPromises` as many times as needed
await flushPromises()
```

# Development
This library is based on the [msw](https://mswjs.io/) library.

## Tests
By default, mock-request clips the stacktrace so that we don't show internals to the user when errors throw but rather point to the line in their test where they used mock-request which caused an error. For debugging tests, this can be annoying - so you can disable this feature by passing the environment variable `AVOID_CLIPPED_STACKTRACE=true`.
